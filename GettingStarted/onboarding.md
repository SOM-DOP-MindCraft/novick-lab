# Onboarding

To make sure you are certified to work within our lab and have access to all necessary databases, follow these steps

## CITI Training

Follow the instructions on the [CU Anschutz COMIRB Site](https://research.cuanschutz.edu/comirb/home/info/training) to complete 'Group 1 Biomedical Investigators' CITI training.

## HIPAA Training

If the data you will be looking at involves PHI, follow the instructions on the [CU Anschutz COMIRB Site](https://research.cuanschutz.edu/comirb/home/info/training) to complete HIPAA training.

## Good Clinical Practice Training

If this is an NIH-funded project, follow the instructions on the [CU Anschutz COMIRB Site](https://research.cuanschutz.edu/comirb/home/info/training) to complete GCP training.  Choose the course that makes most sense for your project.

## REDCap Training

It's likely you'll be using REDCap to either examine data collected as part of a project or to track your own 
activites within a project.  REDCap training is needed to obtain access to these databases and can be found [here](https://cctsi.cuanschutz.edu/resources/informatics/redcap-resources).

Once you've completed your REDCap training, the PI of the project will need to add you as a user.

## Neuroimaging Training

There are a variety of courses and resources available to learning about neuroimaging.  Many of these resources have been compiled in [Dr. Love's Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjYwNTE2ODA2NzA2?cjc=7pjhwys).
